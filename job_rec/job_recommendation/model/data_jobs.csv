About the organisation








At Education Development Trust, we improve school systems at scale; we partner with governments around the world to help turn ambitious, visionary education policy into reality. We invest annually in our programme of education research and this evidence underpins our work and informs policy and practice around the world. We have a long-established presence in Africa ‚Äì running programmes since 1992 ‚Äì and have worked with a range of governments, donor agencies and partners to improve education across the continent, providing short-term, expert consultancy and delivering long-term, national education programmes.¬†We have specialist expertise in sustainable school system reform at scale ‚Äì from improving literacy and numeracy outcomes, to large-scale teacher training and strengthening the capacity of national ministries. We are experienced in leading complex programmes in challenging environments and we also work with like-minded organisations to ensure we maximise our impact.
All offers of employment will be subject to satisfactory references and appropriate screening checks, which can include criminal record checks. Education Development Trust also participates in the Inter-Agency Misconduct Disclosure Scheme, and we may request information from relevant job applicants‚Äô previous employers about any findings of sexual misconduct, including harassment, during employment, or incidents under investigation when the applicant left employment. By submitting an application, the job applicant confirms his/her understanding of these recruitment procedures.

Please note, we will be reviewing applications on an ongoing basis and reserve the right to close our vacancies early.


We understand that¬†artificial intelligence (AI)¬†tools¬†(such as ChatGPT) can be helpful when applying for jobs ‚Äì especially for those who require additional support during the recruitment process. However, while you may decide to use AI tools for ideas or pointers, we request that you do not rely heavily on them when answering questions. We are looking for responses that are personal to you, including details and examples of your abilities and work experience to date, and we consider copying and pasting AI-generated responses to be a misuse of AI tools. Likewise, we do not use AI-driven recruitment screening software, because we value authenticity and prefer to make personal connections with our candidates. If you have used AI to support your application ‚Äì including in emails and responses to questions ‚Äì please disclose this on your application form. If you would like clarification on how AI can be used in your application to EDT, please contact¬†globalresourcing@edt.org

United Nations Development Programme 



Background
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Malawi is implementing the CATALYZE Malawi Project (2025-2028), a transformative project that is leveraging a portfolio approach to drive the country‚Äôs green transition, foster entrepreneurship growth, and unlock alternative financing mechanisms. The project seeks to catalyze a more sustainable, competitive, and resilient economy by promoting environmentally responsible economic practices, nurturing entrepreneurial ventures, and creating an enabling environment for business growth. Key to the project is the development of innovative financing solutions aimed at scaling high-impact, sustainable enterprises that contribute to Malawi‚Äôs broader economic transformation.
The CATALYZE Malawi Project is designed to align with the Government of Malawi‚Äôs agenda for private-sector-led growth, supporting national efforts to achieve sustainable economic development. The project emphasizes business incubation, accelerates the growth of startups, and fosters an ecosystem that attracts impact investments to drive innovation and productivity. It focuses on key sectors essential for Malawi‚Äôs growth, including agriculture, industrialization, and renewable energy among others, positioning these as pillars of a green and inclusive economy.
Within this framework, UNDP Malawi has established itself as a vital partner for growth, innovation, and job creation, addressing systemic challenges that hinder private sector development. Building on the successes and lessons from its predecessor, the Private Sector Development (PSD) II Project, CATALYZE incorporates a suite of strategic initiatives that prioritize entrepreneurship development, enhanced access to finance, and scalable innovations for sustainable enterprise growth.
The project‚Äôs flagship initiatives are pivotal in delivering essential risk capital to startups, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and larger companies. These initiatives aim to unlock entrepreneurial potential, attract impact investments, and accelerate the adoption of climate-smart practices. By doing so, they enable businesses to thrive while supporting Malawi‚Äôs transition to a low-carbon, resilient economy.
Given the project‚Äôs substantial scale, complexity, and ambitious objectives, it is vital to ensure that the team is equipped with the necessary capacity to deliver results effectively. The addition of a Grant Officer is proposed to bolster the team‚Äôs capacity, ensuring that the project achieves its intended outcomes within the set timeline. This is particularly important as the scope and complexity of the project pillars demand specialized expertise, dedicated support and resources.

United Nations Development Programme 



Background
Project Description¬†¬†
The National Registration and Identification System (NRIS) project in Malawi is a comprehensive initiative aimed at creating a centralized database of citizens and residents. This database contains biometric information, such as fingerprints and facial images, as well as demographic data. The primary goal of the NRIS is to provide a secure and reliable means of identifying individuals, which can be used for various purposes, including voter registration, social welfare programs, and law enforcement.
The NRIS project is being implemented by the Malawi Government, with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The project began in 2016 and is expected to be completed by June 2024. It involves the registration of all Malawian citizens who are 16 years and above and residents, as well as the issuance of national identification cards. The project is also conducting birth and death registration and planning to introduce marriage registration.
Following successful implementation of the first phase of National ID registration with over 11 million people registered and smartcards distributed, the NRIS project is currently undergoing a transition to a new initiative known as the ‚ÄúInclusive Digital Transformation for Malawi (IDT4M)‚Äù. This transition after review and consultation with relevant stakeholders was officially endorsed by the Steering Committee on September 6th, 2023. This new direction was based on the emerging concepts of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) with a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and identity Management system at its core. It is increasingly apparent that the ability to respond swiftly and effectively to global crises whether they be health-related, climate change, education economic recession, governance or more‚Äîrequires strong DPI. The DPI includes solutions and systems that enable the effective provision of essential society-wide functions and services in the public and private sectors. This includes but is not limited to digital forms of ID and biometric verification, civil registration, digital transactions, data exchange, and information management systems.
The project‚Äôs renewed focus with inclusion of DPI contributes towards Government of Malawi‚Äôs efforts to guarantee the fundamental right to identity, entitlement, and enjoyment of full citizenship in Malawi. This is consistent with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 and SDG Target 16.9 ‚Äúproviding a legal identity for all and will also facilitate the goal of achieving comprehensive birth registration by 2030‚Äù. This approach offers improvements in development planning, service delivery, and the operation of administrative systems supported by a robust and agile CRVS and ID Management system. Moreover, the project will prioritize bridging the digital gender gap by enhancing digital literacy and productivity skills, particularly among women. The three outputs of the project are:
Output 1: Establishing safe, trusted and inclusive digital ID and CRVS System to guarantee legal identity to all.
Output 2: Enhancing digital governance to advance service delivery while safeguarding human rights; and
Output 3: Reducing digital gender divide by increased digital literacy and productivity.
Scope of Work¬†
The Digital Innovation Analyst will help the IDT4M project to identify, develop, and implement innovative digital solutions that address the needs of marginalized communities and promote inclusive growth.

Hivos 



Call for Proposals: Implementing the Sustainable Action Fund in Malawi
Hivos‚Äô Connect, Defend, Act! team in Malawi is looking for partners to implement the Sustainable Action Fund. The Fund is established to provide targeted financial and technical support for community-driven and civil society-led initiatives that protect, expand and promote inclusive civic space and human rights. Find the details of our work in Malawi and the criteria for this call for proposals below.
Context and background
All around the world, those in power, not only in autocratic governments but in established democracies as well, are increasingly imposing restrictions on civil society to freely express themselves, to protest systemic injustices and to organize themselves to defend fundamental human rights. Digital tools and platforms carry the potential to create safe and brave spaces for trust-based collaboration and increased access to information, but they remain shaped by unequal access, as well as undermined by increasingly sophisticated digital surveillance and attacks by state and non-state actors.
With support from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), Hivos is implementing the¬†Connect, Defend, Act! project. The project will respond to the issue of shrinking civic space and amplify civil society-led action in Malawi by supporting civil society actors in their efforts to defend and expand civic space. Civil society actors and rightsholders who are taking action to defend and expand civic space are confronted with an array of political, institutional, legal, and societal forces actively working against their goals. Civil society actors have needs such as safe and trustworthy spaces for evidence-based learning and strategizing, strengthened capacity to respond to mounting digital attacks, and access to funding to increase organizational flexibility and resilience. The project has the following goals and three strategic objectives:
Project goal
Civil society actors in Malawi can positively influence the openness of and respond to changes in the civic space.
Project objectives

By promoting coalition building among diverse civil society actors, including human rights defenders, rights holder-led civil society organizations, and independent media actors, grounded in civil society-led evidence gathering and knowledge production, and facilitated by context-specific communities of action.
By contributing to safe and inclusive digital civic spaces for sustained collaboration and action among civil society actors through localized holistic digital security capacity strengthening, knowledge production, and active referral to digital protection providers.
By increasing civil society actors‚Äô flexibility to rapidly respond to changes in civic space through organizational capacity strengthening and the provision of strategic funding for sustainable action.

The project aims to strategically support relevant actors within civil society whose work actively contributes to civic space from the perspective of different sectors and interests, particularly including groups who are marginalized within civil society, such as women, youth, marginalized persons, indigenous people, and others. Across all activities and outcomes, the project will promote local ownership and leadership, with Hivos taking a facilitating and supporting role that emphasizes civil society actors‚Äô agency and existing knowledge.
Executive Summary- Connect, Defend, Act! Baseline Study
The baseline study assessed the state of civic space in Malawi, focusing on civil society coalitions, barriers faced by actors, and organizational capacity gaps. The study revealed varying perceptions of the environment among civil society organizations (CSOs), facing challenges in participating in civic activities. Key challenges include resource shortages, legal barriers, threats, intimidation, and institutional constraints. Media actors also highlighted the importance of independent media in promoting civic space, but some felt media independence was compromised by government influence. Threats to civic space were also found, with media actors experiencing physical threats, digital attacks, and legal actions.
Read the baseline study here¬† https://hivos.org/connect-defend-act-baseline-studies-2024
The study also found out that CSOs in Malawi face various digital threats, including phishing, hacking, and online harassment. Despite having a somewhat safe physical environment, half of CSOs reported a mixed public perception of their work. Digital security knowledge among CSOs varied, with 16.7% rated as ‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù 50% as ‚ÄúFair,‚Äù and 33.3% as ‚ÄúPoor.‚Äù To combat these threats, CSOs have implemented measures like antivirus software, firewalls, strong password protocols, and regular training. CSOs indicated that they provide digital security training to their staff. However, there are gaps in organizational capacity for CSOs and media actors in Malawi, with only 83% having access to sustainable funding. Structural barriers, such as limited donor interest, competition, geographic isolation, and bureaucratic processes, hinder access to funds.
The study also found out that half of Central Social Initiatives (CSOs) in Malawi lack contingency plans for emergencies, indicating vulnerabilities in adapting to rapidly changing environments. CSOs felt somewhat prepared, and there were discrepancies in strategy updates, possibly due to resource constraints or inadequate capacity. CSOs‚Äô approaches to addressing capacity gaps varied, with some focusing on internal capacity building and others on external partnerships and funding. Coalitions focused on human rights and gender equality faced challenges, including lack of trust, inadequate funding, poor coordination, and political pressure. Strengthening leadership, securing stable funding, and fostering better coordination are crucial for improving coalition effectiveness in Malawi.
Seeking a Partner
One of the main challenges Civil Society Actors (CSAs) face when responding to emerging threats or sudden opportunities is the limited availability of sustainable, flexible funding beyond narrow project deliverables. Many CSAs operate within a context of financial scarcity and limited organizational sustainability. To address this, the project will provide flexible resources alongside organizational strengthening and external networking support, enhancing CSAs‚Äô strategic capacity to act swiftly ‚Äì either to capitalize on opportunities or to mobilize broad-based support in response to attacks on civic space.
The CDA! project supports initiatives that protect, expand, and promote open and inclusive civic space and human rights. In line with this mission, the¬†Sustainable Action Fund (SAF)¬†is established to provide targeted financial and technical support for community-driven and civil society-led initiatives that demonstrate sustainability, innovation, and impact in defending.
Purpose of the Sustainable Action Fund
The SAF aims to:

Support initiatives that enhance civic space and resilience.
Promote sustainable practices that reinforce democratic governance and human rights
Provide flexible funding for time-sensitive or emerging civic issues.
Strengthen the organizational capacity of local civil society organizations (CSOs).

Scope of the fund
The SAF will support projects in the following thematic areas:

Civic engagement and public participation
Human rights and freedom of expression
Digital rights and online civic space protection
Gender equality and inclusion within civic spaces

Hivos will assess partners based on their experience and expertise in producing outputs relevant to civic space issues, their thematic focus and competencies, and their networks and collaborations with other CSAs. Diversity and inclusion will be central to this selection process, ensuring equitable access to funding and support for women, youth, and marginalized groups.
Partnership selection will favor those aligning with this CDA Theory of Change:¬†IF Human Rights Defenders, CSOs and Media actors are supported to form and sustain coalitions which allow for exchange of experience and learning and make use of safe and inclusive digital civic spaces AND IF these Civil Society Coalitions are empowered to rapidly respond to changes in civic space thanks to increased resources, knowledge, infrastructure and capacity for action, THEN Civil Society Actors will be able to exert influence on the openness of civic space more safely and effectively LEADING TO a more resilient and inclusive civic space which is a crucial condition for thriving, inclusive societies.
Who is encouraged and eligible to apply?
We encourage applications from national, regional, or local civil society actors including Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), grassroots organizations, action-based/movement groups, etc. It is essential that the organizations have balanced composition of youth, women, local/traditional/indigenous, diverse groups and (if any) person with disabilities.
Organizations that meet the following criteria are encouraged to apply:

Registered and based in Malawi, working either at the local, regional, or national level
Proven track record in playing roles as facilitator/convener for civil society actors linking and learning
Proven track record in defending human rights and civic space, particularly the rights of marginalized rights holders
Adequate operational and financial management experience
Clean human rights record, with no involvement in sexual violence
Strong commitment to intersectionality, demonstrated through their work and principles
Led by, or closely collaborating with, youth, women, local/traditional/indigenous, diverse groups, and (if applicable) persons with disabilities
Willing to challenge the status quo of Malawi‚Äôs civic space and collaborate with other stakeholders to connect, defend, and act to protect and expand civic space

Selection criteria
Applications will be assessed using a weighted scoring approach, as specified below:



Quality of the proposal: Demonstrating a strong understanding of the analytical /contextual /logistical issues relevant for a study of this type and the objectives of the baseline study
40%


Quality of the team: Relevant expertise, experience, understanding of the issues, and ability to collaborate productively in an international setting
25%


Quality of the partner‚Äôs best work performed
10%

25%



Specifically, we are looking for:

Clear aim and objectives: A well-defined purpose and set of objectives.
Context analysis: A thorough examination of the What, When, Who, Where, Why, and How (5W1H), demonstrating a deep understanding of the context in which the organization operates.
Holistic approach: A comprehensive perspective on the interconnectedness of civic spaces (digital and non-digital), recognizing not only vibrant civic activities but also strong anti-military/militarization attitudes; not only the presence of dissent but the absence of fear in expressing it; not only the freedom to make decisions but the capacity to make informed decisions; not only confidence in expressing one‚Äôs own voice but solidarity in amplifying the voices of others; and not only openness in physical and digital spaces but also their interconnections, where resistance in one space supports resistance in the other.
Rightsholder representation: Demonstrated commitment to involving, representing, and amplifying the voices of vulnerable and marginalized groups (e.g., youth, women, local/traditional/indigenous communities, diverse groups, persons with disabilities).
Utilization of CDA! baseline study:¬†Integrate the plan of how these resources, including civic space monitoring reports produced by other CDA partners, will be used as knowledge products, learning materials, and tools for collaboration, advocacy, and campaigns.
Innovation: The degree to which the proposal proposes innovative, accessible, relevant, and user-friendly activities and outputs.
Intersectional approach: A clear integration of intersectional (examining the different levels of powers and vulnerabilities) considerations throughout the proposed activities and outputs.

Are you ready to drive meaningful change in global health? GOAL 3 is seeking a Country Manager for Malawi, a pivotal role that combines strategic relationship management, commercial thinking, and operational excellence to scale our impact in healthcare delivery.
About GOAL 3
GOAL 3 is a social enterprise that has developed the IMPALA patient monitoring system, empowering health workers to monitor and manage patients more effectively. IMPALA enables hospitals to shift from reactive care to a proactive approach, ensuring timely interventions for every patient. Our system is already approved and used in Rwanda, Malawi, and Tanzania.
By automating tasks and providing clinical insights, IMPALA significantly reduces health worker burden (91% report a reduced workload), pediatric hospital mortality (-40%), and admission time (-10%). See our website, www.goal3.org, for more details.

The NGO CCR‚Äôs mission is to contribute towards the promotion, respect, protection and fulfilment of children‚Äôs rights through evidence based Advocacy, Coordination, Capacity building and Research, monitoring and reporting. The NGO CCR is currently the Executive Board member of the Child Rights Networks for Southern Africa (CRNSA), which is a SADC regional level body of non-state actors for Child Rights.

We empower young people, women in small businesses, community leaders, and school-going children with skills that help them grow and succeed in their communities.
We are looking for six Volunteer Facilitators who are passionate about working with children. The program will run for 1 month at our centers in Area 56, Mtandire (near Muzu Primary School), Njewa, and Mtsiliza, all located in Lilongwe.
Duties and Responsibilities
As a volunteer facilitator, you will:
‚Ä¢ Teach and guide children using the Children‚Äôs Life Skills curriculum, ensuring lessons are fun, interactive, and age-appropriate
‚Ä¢ Prepare and organize learning materials and activities in advance
‚Ä¢ Lead children in group discussions, games, songs, storytelling, and role-plays that promote life skills, respect, and teamwork
‚Ä¢ Create and maintain a safe, supportive, and respectful learning environment for all children
‚Ä¢ Observe and monitor each child‚Äôs participation, behaviour, and progress
‚Ä¢ Encourage good manners, confidence, and respectful communication among children
‚Ä¢ Handle minor conflicts among children calmly and promote positive discipline techniques
‚Ä¢ Report any concerns or challenges (e.g., behavioural or emotional issues) to the program team
‚Ä¢ Communicate regularly with other facilitators and staff to ensure smooth delivery of the program
‚Ä¢ Participate in team planning meetings and training sessions to improve your facilitation and child engagement skills
To apply for this role, you must:
‚Ä¢ Have a certificate, diploma, or degree in Early Childhood Development or a related field.
‚Ä¢ Have a strong passion for working with children, especially those from peri-urban communities.
‚Ä¢ Have good facilitation skills and some experience working with children.
‚Ä¢ Be 35 years of age or younger.
‚Ä¢ Live in Lilongwe, preferably near one of the centers listed.
‚Ä¢ Be willing to volunteer your time and skills.
Please do not apply if you do not have a passion for working with children or for volunteer work.
Benefits:
All volunteers will receive a transport stipend. You will also gain hands-on experience working with children, improve your facilitation and communication skills, and learn how to manage and deliver community-based programs.
If you are interested, please send your application letter, CV, and copies of your certificate(s) to: tingathesocials@gmail.com. The deadline to apply is 17th July 2025 at 4:30 PM.
