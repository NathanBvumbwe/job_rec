Hivos 



Call for Proposals: Implementing the Sustainable Action Fund in Malawi
Hivos’ Connect, Defend, Act! team in Malawi is looking for partners to implement the Sustainable Action Fund. The Fund is established to provide targeted financial and technical support for community-driven and civil society-led initiatives that protect, expand and promote inclusive civic space and human rights. Find the details of our work in Malawi and the criteria for this call for proposals below.
Context and background
All around the world, those in power, not only in autocratic governments but in established democracies as well, are increasingly imposing restrictions on civil society to freely express themselves, to protest systemic injustices and to organize themselves to defend fundamental human rights. Digital tools and platforms carry the potential to create safe and brave spaces for trust-based collaboration and increased access to information, but they remain shaped by unequal access, as well as undermined by increasingly sophisticated digital surveillance and attacks by state and non-state actors.
With support from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), Hivos is implementing the Connect, Defend, Act! project. The project will respond to the issue of shrinking civic space and amplify civil society-led action in Malawi by supporting civil society actors in their efforts to defend and expand civic space. Civil society actors and rightsholders who are taking action to defend and expand civic space are confronted with an array of political, institutional, legal, and societal forces actively working against their goals. Civil society actors have needs such as safe and trustworthy spaces for evidence-based learning and strategizing, strengthened capacity to respond to mounting digital attacks, and access to funding to increase organizational flexibility and resilience. The project has the following goals and three strategic objectives:
Project goal
Civil society actors in Malawi can positively influence the openness of and respond to changes in the civic space.
Project objectives

By promoting coalition building among diverse civil society actors, including human rights defenders, rights holder-led civil society organizations, and independent media actors, grounded in civil society-led evidence gathering and knowledge production, and facilitated by context-specific communities of action.
By contributing to safe and inclusive digital civic spaces for sustained collaboration and action among civil society actors through localized holistic digital security capacity strengthening, knowledge production, and active referral to digital protection providers.
By increasing civil society actors’ flexibility to rapidly respond to changes in civic space through organizational capacity strengthening and the provision of strategic funding for sustainable action.

The project aims to strategically support relevant actors within civil society whose work actively contributes to civic space from the perspective of different sectors and interests, particularly including groups who are marginalized within civil society, such as women, youth, marginalized persons, indigenous people, and others. Across all activities and outcomes, the project will promote local ownership and leadership, with Hivos taking a facilitating and supporting role that emphasizes civil society actors’ agency and existing knowledge.
Executive Summary- Connect, Defend, Act! Baseline Study
The baseline study assessed the state of civic space in Malawi, focusing on civil society coalitions, barriers faced by actors, and organizational capacity gaps. The study revealed varying perceptions of the environment among civil society organizations (CSOs), facing challenges in participating in civic activities. Key challenges include resource shortages, legal barriers, threats, intimidation, and institutional constraints. Media actors also highlighted the importance of independent media in promoting civic space, but some felt media independence was compromised by government influence. Threats to civic space were also found, with media actors experiencing physical threats, digital attacks, and legal actions.
Read the baseline study here  https://hivos.org/connect-defend-act-baseline-studies-2024
The study also found out that CSOs in Malawi face various digital threats, including phishing, hacking, and online harassment. Despite having a somewhat safe physical environment, half of CSOs reported a mixed public perception of their work. Digital security knowledge among CSOs varied, with 16.7% rated as “Excellent,” 50% as “Fair,” and 33.3% as “Poor.” To combat these threats, CSOs have implemented measures like antivirus software, firewalls, strong password protocols, and regular training. CSOs indicated that they provide digital security training to their staff. However, there are gaps in organizational capacity for CSOs and media actors in Malawi, with only 83% having access to sustainable funding. Structural barriers, such as limited donor interest, competition, geographic isolation, and bureaucratic processes, hinder access to funds.
The study also found out that half of Central Social Initiatives (CSOs) in Malawi lack contingency plans for emergencies, indicating vulnerabilities in adapting to rapidly changing environments. CSOs felt somewhat prepared, and there were discrepancies in strategy updates, possibly due to resource constraints or inadequate capacity. CSOs’ approaches to addressing capacity gaps varied, with some focusing on internal capacity building and others on external partnerships and funding. Coalitions focused on human rights and gender equality faced challenges, including lack of trust, inadequate funding, poor coordination, and political pressure. Strengthening leadership, securing stable funding, and fostering better coordination are crucial for improving coalition effectiveness in Malawi.
Seeking a Partner
One of the main challenges Civil Society Actors (CSAs) face when responding to emerging threats or sudden opportunities is the limited availability of sustainable, flexible funding beyond narrow project deliverables. Many CSAs operate within a context of financial scarcity and limited organizational sustainability. To address this, the project will provide flexible resources alongside organizational strengthening and external networking support, enhancing CSAs’ strategic capacity to act swiftly – either to capitalize on opportunities or to mobilize broad-based support in response to attacks on civic space.
The CDA! project supports initiatives that protect, expand, and promote open and inclusive civic space and human rights. In line with this mission, the Sustainable Action Fund (SAF) is established to provide targeted financial and technical support for community-driven and civil society-led initiatives that demonstrate sustainability, innovation, and impact in defending.
Purpose of the Sustainable Action Fund
The SAF aims to:

Support initiatives that enhance civic space and resilience.
Promote sustainable practices that reinforce democratic governance and human rights
Provide flexible funding for time-sensitive or emerging civic issues.
Strengthen the organizational capacity of local civil society organizations (CSOs).

Scope of the fund
The SAF will support projects in the following thematic areas:

Civic engagement and public participation
Human rights and freedom of expression
Digital rights and online civic space protection
Gender equality and inclusion within civic spaces

Hivos will assess partners based on their experience and expertise in producing outputs relevant to civic space issues, their thematic focus and competencies, and their networks and collaborations with other CSAs. Diversity and inclusion will be central to this selection process, ensuring equitable access to funding and support for women, youth, and marginalized groups.
Partnership selection will favor those aligning with this CDA Theory of Change: IF Human Rights Defenders, CSOs and Media actors are supported to form and sustain coalitions which allow for exchange of experience and learning and make use of safe and inclusive digital civic spaces AND IF these Civil Society Coalitions are empowered to rapidly respond to changes in civic space thanks to increased resources, knowledge, infrastructure and capacity for action, THEN Civil Society Actors will be able to exert influence on the openness of civic space more safely and effectively LEADING TO a more resilient and inclusive civic space which is a crucial condition for thriving, inclusive societies.
Who is encouraged and eligible to apply?
We encourage applications from national, regional, or local civil society actors including Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), grassroots organizations, action-based/movement groups, etc. It is essential that the organizations have balanced composition of youth, women, local/traditional/indigenous, diverse groups and (if any) person with disabilities.
Organizations that meet the following criteria are encouraged to apply:

Registered and based in Malawi, working either at the local, regional, or national level
Proven track record in playing roles as facilitator/convener for civil society actors linking and learning
Proven track record in defending human rights and civic space, particularly the rights of marginalized rights holders
Adequate operational and financial management experience
Clean human rights record, with no involvement in sexual violence
Strong commitment to intersectionality, demonstrated through their work and principles
Led by, or closely collaborating with, youth, women, local/traditional/indigenous, diverse groups, and (if applicable) persons with disabilities
Willing to challenge the status quo of Malawi’s civic space and collaborate with other stakeholders to connect, defend, and act to protect and expand civic space

Selection criteria
Applications will be assessed using a weighted scoring approach, as specified below:



Quality of the proposal: Demonstrating a strong understanding of the analytical /contextual /logistical issues relevant for a study of this type and the objectives of the baseline study
40%


Quality of the team: Relevant expertise, experience, understanding of the issues, and ability to collaborate productively in an international setting
25%


Quality of the partner’s best work performed
10%

Holistic approach: A comprehensive perspective on the interconnectedness of civic spaces (digital and non-digital), recognizing not only vibrant civic activities but also strong anti-military/militarization attitudes; not only the presence of dissent but the absence of fear in expressing it; not only the freedom to make decisions but the capacity to make informed decisions; not only confidence in expressing one’s own voice but solidarity in amplifying the voices of others; and not only openness in physical and digital spaces but also their interconnections, where resistance in one space supports resistance in the other.
Rightsholder representation: Demonstrated commitment to involving, representing, and amplifying the voices of vulnerable and marginalized groups (e.g., youth, women, local/traditional/indigenous communities, diverse groups, persons with disabilities).
Utilization of CDA! baseline study: Integrate the plan of how these resources, including civic space monitoring reports produced by other CDA partners, will be used as knowledge products, learning materials, and tools for collaboration, advocacy, and campaigns.

As a federal enterprise, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH supports the German Government in achieving its objective in the field of international cooperation for sustainable development. GIZ operates in more than 130 countries around the globe. In Malawi, GIZ has been working for more than 50 years. Malawi is a priority for German international cooperation and currently focuses on three priority areas: health and social protection, good financial governance and private sector development in rural areas. In addition to our work on these areas, we also work on food systems and nutrition.

We believe in the power and potential of every child but know this is often suppressed by poverty, violence, exclusion and discrimination. And it is girls who are most affected. Working together with children, young people, supporters and partners, we strive for a just world, tackling the root causes of the challenges girls and vulnerable children face. We support children’s rights from birth until they reach adulthood and we enable children to prepare for and respond to crises and adversity. We drive changes in practice and policy at local, national and global levels using our reach, experience and knowledge. For over 85 years, we have rallied other determined optimists to transform the lives of all children in more than 80 countries. We won’t stop until we are all equal. The Opportunity Our new global strategy prioritises humanitarian scale up. To respond to the growing unmet needs in emergencies and to strengthen the speed, quality, relevance and appropriateness of our emergency response and readiness work, we are investing in our  humanitarian deployable capacity. The Deployable Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) Programme Specialist is a member of Plan International’s Global Education in Humanitarian action unit. While on deployment, the specialist provides technical support to Plan International’s Country Offices (COs). This normally involves responding to medium and large-scale emergencies to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate humanitarian MHPSS programmes. This includes providing technical leadership and support on programme strategy, strengthening the capacity of staff and partners on MHPSS, and ensuring the overall technical quality of Plan’s MHPSS programming in line with humanitarian standards. Plan International’s MHPSS programming focuses on group activities for child and adolescent well-being, focused psychosocial care and support, including for parents and caregivers, and strengthening access to specialised mental health services. Plan International implements MHPSS programmes directly as well as with implementing partners and service providers. This role will have a specific focus on MHPSS programming, with key interventions firmly embedded within or linked to humanitarian response programmes for child protection in emergencies (CPiE), education in emergencies (EiE), food security and nutrition (FSN) and other life-saving assistance. When not on deployment, the specialist contributes to Plan’s global humanitarian workplans for CPiE and EiE as agreed with both global units.

VSO Malawi 




Office Assistant at VSO Malawi. Lilongwe, Malawi
 







Working at VSO
VSO is the world’s leading international non-governmental organisation that works through volunteers to create a fair world for everyone. In 2022/23, over 7,700 dedicated individuals from across the globe volunteered with VSO, bringing their abilities to support almost 11 million people in 35 countries.
Our work centres on those who are left out by society – those living in extreme poverty or with disability and illness. Those who face discrimination and violence because of their gender, sexuality, or social status. Those who are at risk from disaster, disease, and conflict.
But they are not passive beneficiaries of aid; they are the “primary actors” at the heart of our efforts. From their perspective, we define the issues, opportunities, and solutions that drive sustainable, local-led change. These individuals are the key agents of their own transformation.
