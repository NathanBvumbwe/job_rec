About the organisation








At Education Development Trust, we improve school systems at scale; we partner with governments around the world to help turn ambitious, visionary education policy into reality. We invest annually in our programme of education research and this evidence underpins our work and informs policy and practice around the world. We have a long-established presence in Africa – running programmes since 1992 – and have worked with a range of governments, donor agencies and partners to improve education across the continent, providing short-term, expert consultancy and delivering long-term, national education programmes. We have specialist expertise in sustainable school system reform at scale – from improving literacy and numeracy outcomes, to large-scale teacher training and strengthening the capacity of national ministries. We are experienced in leading complex programmes in challenging environments and we also work with like-minded organisations to ensure we maximise our impact.
All offers of employment will be subject to satisfactory references and appropriate screening checks, which can include criminal record checks. Education Development Trust also participates in the Inter-Agency Misconduct Disclosure Scheme, and we may request information from relevant job applicants’ previous employers about any findings of sexual misconduct, including harassment, during employment, or incidents under investigation when the applicant left employment. By submitting an application, the job applicant confirms his/her understanding of these recruitment procedures.

Please note, we will be reviewing applications on an ongoing basis and reserve the right to close our vacancies early.


We understand that artificial intelligence (AI) tools (such as ChatGPT) can be helpful when applying for jobs – especially for those who require additional support during the recruitment process. However, while you may decide to use AI tools for ideas or pointers, we request that you do not rely heavily on them when answering questions. We are looking for responses that are personal to you, including details and examples of your abilities and work experience to date, and we consider copying and pasting AI-generated responses to be a misuse of AI tools. Likewise, we do not use AI-driven recruitment screening software, because we value authenticity and prefer to make personal connections with our candidates. If you have used AI to support your application – including in emails and responses to questions – please disclose this on your application form. If you would like clarification on how AI can be used in your application to EDT, please contact globalresourcing@edt.org

United Nations Development Programme 



Background
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Malawi is implementing the CATALYZE Malawi Project (2025-2028), a transformative project that is leveraging a portfolio approach to drive the country’s green transition, foster entrepreneurship growth, and unlock alternative financing mechanisms. The project seeks to catalyze a more sustainable, competitive, and resilient economy by promoting environmentally responsible economic practices, nurturing entrepreneurial ventures, and creating an enabling environment for business growth. Key to the project is the development of innovative financing solutions aimed at scaling high-impact, sustainable enterprises that contribute to Malawi’s broader economic transformation.
The CATALYZE Malawi Project is designed to align with the Government of Malawi’s agenda for private-sector-led growth, supporting national efforts to achieve sustainable economic development. The project emphasizes business incubation, accelerates the growth of startups, and fosters an ecosystem that attracts impact investments to drive innovation and productivity. It focuses on key sectors essential for Malawi’s growth, including agriculture, industrialization, and renewable energy among others, positioning these as pillars of a green and inclusive economy.
Within this framework, UNDP Malawi has established itself as a vital partner for growth, innovation, and job creation, addressing systemic challenges that hinder private sector development. Building on the successes and lessons from its predecessor, the Private Sector Development (PSD) II Project, CATALYZE incorporates a suite of strategic initiatives that prioritize entrepreneurship development, enhanced access to finance, and scalable innovations for sustainable enterprise growth.
The project’s flagship initiatives are pivotal in delivering essential risk capital to startups, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and larger companies. These initiatives aim to unlock entrepreneurial potential, attract impact investments, and accelerate the adoption of climate-smart practices. By doing so, they enable businesses to thrive while supporting Malawi’s transition to a low-carbon, resilient economy.
Given the project’s substantial scale, complexity, and ambitious objectives, it is vital to ensure that the team is equipped with the necessary capacity to deliver results effectively. The addition of a Grant Officer is proposed to bolster the team’s capacity, ensuring that the project achieves its intended outcomes within the set timeline. This is particularly important as the scope and complexity of the project pillars demand specialized expertise, dedicated support and resources.
It is on this note that UNDP is seeking to acquire services of a National Grant Officer to provide grant management support services primarily across the Growth Accelerator Malawi (GA), the Green Economic Transition Facility (GETF), and the Export Growth and Competitiveness Facility (EGCF) under the guidance and direct supervision of the Programme Coordinator Green/Inclusive Growth and in close collaboration with the UNDP Programme Analyst, Private Sector Development and with the GETF/GA Service Provider.

Ensure Fiduciary Management
The National Grant Officer will closely monitor and have functions applying to all the projects already contracted. The National Grant Officer will manage milestones on behalf of the GA, GETF and EGCF and be accountable to UNDP for such actions. The services provided will include:

Ensure Monitoring and Reporting
The National Grant Officer will provide effective monitoring and reporting, focusing on the following results:

Monitoring closely the portfolio at risk;
Monitoring the progress of projects against the original application and the implementation agreement or any agreed revisions thereof, and in the event, that the project departs from the original plan or other difficulties arise, work with the Grantee to address and resolve the shortcomings, seeking the advice and guidance of the Investment Panel and UNDP as necessary;
Take such action as is necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the contract, in the event that the integrity of the instruments or its funds are put at risk by any funded project;
Ensuring that the instruments operate transparently and according to schedule;
