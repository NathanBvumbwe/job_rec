Tingathe Malawi 



Volunteers
Tingathe Malawi is looking for volunteers to help us run our Children’s Life Skills Program. We are a non-governmental organization that works with peri-urban communities to build wealth that sticks. We empower young people, women in small businesses, community leaders, and school-going children with skills that help them grow and succeed in their communities.
We are looking for six Volunteer Facilitators who are passionate about working with children. The program will run for 1 month at our centers in Area 56, Mtandire (near Muzu Primary School), Njewa, and Mtsiliza, all located in Lilongwe.
Duties and Responsibilities
As a volunteer facilitator, you will:
• Teach and guide children using the Children’s Life Skills curriculum, ensuring lessons are fun, interactive, and age-appropriate
• Prepare and organize learning materials and activities in advance
• Lead children in group discussions, games, songs, storytelling, and role-plays that promote life skills, respect, and teamwork
• Create and maintain a safe, supportive, and respectful learning environment for all children
• Observe and monitor each child’s participation, behaviour, and progress
• Encourage good manners, confidence, and respectful communication among children
• Handle minor conflicts among children calmly and promote positive discipline techniques
• Report any concerns or challenges (e.g., behavioural or emotional issues) to the program team
• Communicate regularly with other facilitators and staff to ensure smooth delivery of the program
• Participate in team planning meetings and training sessions to improve your facilitation and child engagement skills
To apply for this role, you must:
• Have a certificate, diploma, or degree in Early Childhood Development or a related field.
• Have a strong passion for working with children, especially those from peri-urban communities.
• Have good facilitation skills and some experience working with children.
• Be 35 years of age or younger.
• Live in Lilongwe, preferably near one of the centers listed.
• Be willing to volunteer your time and skills.
Please do not apply if you do not have a passion for working with children or for volunteer work.
Benefits:
All volunteers will receive a transport stipend. You will also gain hands-on experience working with children, improve your facilitation and communication skills, and learn how to manage and deliver community-based programs.
If you are interested, please send your application letter, CV, and copies of your certificate(s) to: tingathesocials@gmail.com. The deadline to apply is 17th July 2025 at 4:30 PM.




To apply for this job email your details to tingathesocials@gmail.com
