GOAL 3 



Country Manager – Malawi: Lead the Future of Healthcare Innovation
Are you ready to drive meaningful change in global health? GOAL 3 is seeking a Country Manager for Malawi, a pivotal role that combines strategic relationship management, commercial thinking, and operational excellence to scale our impact in healthcare delivery.
About GOAL 3
GOAL 3 is a social enterprise that has developed the IMPALA patient monitoring system, empowering health workers to monitor and manage patients more effectively. IMPALA enables hospitals to shift from reactive care to a proactive approach, ensuring timely interventions for every patient. Our system is already approved and used in Rwanda, Malawi, and Tanzania.
By automating tasks and providing clinical insights, IMPALA significantly reduces health worker burden (91% report a reduced workload), pediatric hospital mortality (-40%), and admission time (-10%). See our website, www.goal3.org, for more details.
Shape the Future of Healthcare in Malawi
As Country Manager, you’ll lead GOAL 3’s expansion in Malawi, working directly with the COO and CEO to scale our operations, secure hospital subscriptions, and strengthen government partnerships. This role offers a unique opportunity to build a sustainable, scalable model that maximizes both impact and financial sustainability.
Your Impact

Strategic Leadership: Develop and implement Malawi’s growth strategy, ensuring alignment with GOAL 3’s mission.
Government & Hospital Engagement: Build strong relationships with health ministries, hospital administrators, and funders to drive adoption of IMPALA.
Hospital Subscription Growth: Lead efforts to get hospitals subscribed, good hospital relations, happy customers, and successful payments, through strong in-person engagement.
Regulatory Compliance: Maintain compliance with Malawi healthcare regulations and oversee required local certifications.
Operational Management: Oversee service delivery, logistics, clearance and stock management, ensuring a high uptime of IMPALA in hospitals.
Service partner & Local Team Development: Build a strong capacity to ensure delivery of sustainable service models fit for the Malawi context.

Why This Role Matters Now

Strong Government Buy-in: After being the first country where Impala got implemented in several hospitals, with overwhelmingly positive results, Malawi could greatly benefit from scaling IMPALA to additional hospitals.
Hospitals Moving to Subscription Model: With new hospitals starting subscriptions, strong local leadership is needed to assure compliance to service contracts and ongoing customer satisfaction.
In-Person Effort is Key: Success depends on local engagement—too much of GOAL3’s effort is currently reliant on remote support.
Scaling Demand: With an increasing number of hospitals adopting IMPALA, on-the-ground efforts will only continue to grow.

What You’ll Bring

Entrepreneurial Mindset: A self-starter who thrives in a fast-growing, high-impact organization.
Strong Relationship Management: Experience engaging government stakeholders, hospitals, distributors, NGO’s and donors.
Business & Financial Acumen: Ability to drive hospital subscriptions, ensure payments, and manage local budgets.
Operational & Program Management: Skilled in implementing healthcare programs and managing partners. Building a team and creating a conducive work environment.
Healthcare Sector Experience: Background in medical technology, global health, or hospital administration.
Fluency in English & Chichewa.

What We Offer

Competitive salary (additional benefits in consultation)
A leadership role in an innovative healthcare company, making a real impact.
Direct involvement in high-level strategic decisions with the COO & CEO.

Through its Country Offices, or FAO Representations, FAO assists governments to develop policies, programmes and projects to address hunger and malnutrition, and provides technical support for the sustainable development of their agricultural, fisheries and forestry sectors.

Tasks and responsibilities
Risk Management and Fraud Preventio

Develop and institutionalise a comprehensive and practical Risk Management framework, incorporating regular (bi-annual or annual) fraud risk assessments and mitigation plans.

Coordinate the preparation, periodic updating, and maintenance of the country office’s risk register. Monitor the implementation status of mitigation measures across programme and operations.
Lead office-wide risk mapping, peer reviews, and regular field monitoring missions to assess and verify compliance and operational risks.

Advise management on anti-fraud measures by analysing trends and lessons learned from past investigations and recommend actionable prevention strategies and corrective measures accordingly.
Institutionalise fraud detection mechanisms through the use of data analytics to identify financial irregularities, establish whistleblower reporting protocols, and implement staff training and reference tools such as red-flag checklists.
Localise and implement the FAO corporate Anti-Fraud Strategy within the Country Office, recommend internal fraud prevention mechanisms, and proactively alert management to any identified fraudulent activities or unethical conduct.
Develop and implement a risk-based framework for unannounced field visits, ensuring that at least 20% of high-value projects are covered annually.
Conduct thorough vendor due diligence and strengthen procurement oversight through pre-qualification screening (e.g. background checks, sanctions lists, and litigation history) and post-award audits using random sampling to verify that goods and services delivered align with invoiced amounts.
Undertake due diligence reviews of implementing partners, monitor their financial accountability and reporting, and carry out partner spot-checks as appropriate.
Lead the design and facilitation of fraud risk awareness training and orientation sessions for employees, implementing partners, and suppliers.
Contribute to effective management by actively participating in key governance meetings, including the Operations Management Team (OMT) and the Senior Management Team (SMT), and other strategic fora.

Compliance to rules, regulations and guidelines

Review office systems, procedures, and processes to ensure compliance with FAO rules and regulations, donor contractual obligations, and applicable national laws.
Strengthen and enforce internal controls to ensure effective mechanisms are in place to prevent, detect, and report non-compliance. Additionally, support periodic audits, investigations, and the preparation of internal control reports.
Assess internal work processes in Programme and Operations to ensure that roles and accountabilities are clearly defined and aligned with organisational policies and recognised best practices.
Establish and implement a risk-based system to periodically and systematically review a representative sample of Programme and Operations activities, verifying compliance with established workflows and corporate policies.
Lead preparations for and support the implementation of headquarters-led audits and investigations. Conduct quality assurance reviews, track implementation of recommendations, and provide timely updates to management.
Periodically conduct tests and simulations to assess compliance with applicable rules, policies, and procedures, and ensure staff understanding and accountability.

Create awareness/capacity building

Establish a system for documenting and reporting weaknesses in internal controls and implement corrective actions to address identified gaps (e.g. through SOPs, internal memos, etc.), while strengthening the capacity of responsible staff.
Analyse the cause-and-effect implications of policy changes on office operations, anticipate their impact, and advise on adaptive approaches to improve efficiency and compliance.
Support the implementation of a continuous learning and development plan for the Risk and Compliance function.
Ensure that management enables staff access to relevant training, and that all personnel are familiar with key workplace policies, including those related to PSEA, fraud prevention, and ethical conduct. Extend similar awareness and training to implementing partners and suppliers where appropriate.
