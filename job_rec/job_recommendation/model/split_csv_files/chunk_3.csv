United Nations Development Programme 



Background
Project Description  
The National Registration and Identification System (NRIS) project in Malawi is a comprehensive initiative aimed at creating a centralized database of citizens and residents. This database contains biometric information, such as fingerprints and facial images, as well as demographic data. The primary goal of the NRIS is to provide a secure and reliable means of identifying individuals, which can be used for various purposes, including voter registration, social welfare programs, and law enforcement.
The NRIS project is being implemented by the Malawi Government, with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The project began in 2016 and is expected to be completed by June 2024. It involves the registration of all Malawian citizens who are 16 years and above and residents, as well as the issuance of national identification cards. The project is also conducting birth and death registration and planning to introduce marriage registration.
Following successful implementation of the first phase of National ID registration with over 11 million people registered and smartcards distributed, the NRIS project is currently undergoing a transition to a new initiative known as the “Inclusive Digital Transformation for Malawi (IDT4M)”. This transition after review and consultation with relevant stakeholders was officially endorsed by the Steering Committee on September 6th, 2023. This new direction was based on the emerging concepts of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) with a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and identity Management system at its core. It is increasingly apparent that the ability to respond swiftly and effectively to global crises whether they be health-related, climate change, education economic recession, governance or more—requires strong DPI. The DPI includes solutions and systems that enable the effective provision of essential society-wide functions and services in the public and private sectors. This includes but is not limited to digital forms of ID and biometric verification, civil registration, digital transactions, data exchange, and information management systems.
The project’s renewed focus with inclusion of DPI contributes towards Government of Malawi’s efforts to guarantee the fundamental right to identity, entitlement, and enjoyment of full citizenship in Malawi. This is consistent with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 and SDG Target 16.9 “providing a legal identity for all and will also facilitate the goal of achieving comprehensive birth registration by 2030”. This approach offers improvements in development planning, service delivery, and the operation of administrative systems supported by a robust and agile CRVS and ID Management system. Moreover, the project will prioritize bridging the digital gender gap by enhancing digital literacy and productivity skills, particularly among women. The three outputs of the project are:
Output 1: Establishing safe, trusted and inclusive digital ID and CRVS System to guarantee legal identity to all.
Output 2: Enhancing digital governance to advance service delivery while safeguarding human rights; and
Output 3: Reducing digital gender divide by increased digital literacy and productivity.
Scope of Work
